# Postify - A Simple Post Viewer

## Project Overview

**Postify** is a web application that allows users to explore and interact with posts and their related comments. The goal of this project is to practice working with real-time data, fetching data from an API, and displaying it in a user-friendly interface. 

This project fetches posts and comments from the **DummyJSON** API and displays them in an intuitive format for users to read and interact with. The application also includes a search feature to filter posts based on titles.

## Features

- **Post List:** Displays a list of posts with the title, body, and reaction counts (likes and dislikes).
- **Comments Section:** Each post has an associated comments section, showing the user, comment body, and like count.
- **Search Bar:** Allows users to filter posts based on the post title.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work well on various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

## Technologies Used

- **React üß±:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows efficient rendering of components and managing the application's state. It‚Äôs used in this project to render posts and comments dynamically.
- **Axios üåê:** A promise-based HTTP client used for making requests to the **DummyJSON** API to fetch posts and comments. Axios simplifies handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Framer Motion ü™Ñ:** A library for animations and transitions in React applications. It enhances the UI with smooth animations when rendering posts and other elements.
- **Bootstrap üñ•Ô∏è:** A popular front-end framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. Bootstrap provides pre-built components like cards, buttons, and grid systems, making development faster and easier.
